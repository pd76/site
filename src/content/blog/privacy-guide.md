With the increase in cyberattacks and surveillance of everyday people by a variety of bad actors[^1], taking your privacy and security is increasingly important. By design[^2], the technology you use tracks where you are, what you are doing, and who you talk to. This data is then sold on to advertisers, data brokers, and sometimes even criminals, who will use it against you to increase prices and attempt to influence the ways in which you see the world.

I must warn you, the privacy journey is long and requires a willingness to think about technology in new ways, but I assure you, the benefits are well worth the effort.

First, you need to assess your situation and figure out what degree of privacy you need and what threats you might face. This is known as threat modelling, and it will help you make rational decisions that will benefit you long term.

Generally, a threat model consists of five questions to ask yourself:
1. What do I want to protect? Eg. family photos, bank account, political affiliation, or text messages.
1. Who do I want to protect it from? Eg. online creeps, a resentful ex, or fraudsters.
1. What will happen if I fail to protect it? Eg. identity theft, extortion, job loss, or negative press coverage.
1. What is the liklihood that I will need to protect it? An adversary is likely much more interested in things that have value to them or could be damaging to you.
1. What amount of time and effort am I willing to put forth to protect it? This will determine what is an appropriate place to stop on the graph above.
