With the increase in cyberattacks and surveillance of everyday people by a variety of bad actors[^1], taking your privacy and security is increasingly important. By design, the technology you use tracks where you are, what you are doing, and who you talk to. This data is then sold on to advertisers, data brokers, and sometimes even criminals, who will use it against you to increase prices and attempt to influence the ways in which you see the world.

I must warn you, the privacy journey is long and requires a willingness to think about technology in new ways, but I assure you, the benefits are well worth the effort.
