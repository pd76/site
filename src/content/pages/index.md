I'm Patrick, an aspiring generalist in the field of computer science, with a particular focus on designing and implementing secure, resilient, and privacy-centric communication systems. My work explores how technological advancements shape and are shaped by society.

This space serves as my personal research journal, where I document my insights, experiments, and ongoing projects in the realm of computer science and its societal impacts. I suggest visiting [/journal](/journal), where you'll find my research notes, project updates, and thoughts on the landscape of technology and its influence on our lives.
