Hello there, my name is Patrick Dinegan,

I'm an aspiring generalist in the field of computer science, with a particular focus on designing and implementing secure, resilient, and privacy-centric communication systems. My work explores how technological advancements shape and are shaped by society.

This space serves as my personal research journal, where I document my insights, experiments, and ongoing projects in the realm of computer science and its societal impacts. For a more comprehensive view of my work and thoughts, please visit [/journal](/journal), where you'll find my research notes, project updates, and reflections on the ever-evolving landscape of technology and its influence on our lives.
